I’m a big fan of Harry Potter and I love the idea of building the Weasly’s Magic Clock. The technology behind it (geofencing and a tracking application) seems simple and effective. With the hardware already set up we can spend a large majority of our time on class subject matters rather than messing with those and the hardware can provide immediate feedback on server functionality. I would like to be more involved in the back end with the databases and geofencing. 
Business:
	There are already other versions of this that have been done and are open source, monetizing this in any large measure probably wouldn’t work out well. If we did sell this, it would probably have a market, but would require royalties to be paid. 
Legal: 
	We don’t own any intellectual rights to Harry Potter, so we need to be careful in how we approach copyrighted images, intellectual properties, etc. Any other issues should be avoided by being open source. 
Technical:
	The project has the potential to have huge time sinks in hardware if something goes wrong, but that can be circumvented through a UI on the app if that happens. Another time sink could be the app. As far as databases and technical challenge go, I think that creating custom geofences sounds fun to learn and implement, and the project should easily be able to make good use of database to keep track of geofences.
