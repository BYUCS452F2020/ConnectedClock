#### Response from Alec Petersen
Heeyyoo! So the actual idea is super neat and I'm always down to one-up the wizarding community with software. I like the idea of keeping it open
source, nice and simple and we don't get sued by the Weasleys or NBCUniversal. I like using Java for the backend and while I haven't used Kotlin yet
I am pretty confident I'll be able to pick up for the client side. I do have experience working with arduinos and hardware (that's really what most
of my real life experience has been with) so I love that this includes that side of things as well. I think it would be fun to also develop an iOS app
if we have time because I bought a mac and the excuse I made to myself to spend $2800 on this thing was that it would be easier to develop apps for 
iOS. All in all this is a very cool idea!
