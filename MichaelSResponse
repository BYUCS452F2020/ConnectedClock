This sounds like an amazing idea! When you were presenting it, I thought that you would use a magic mirror type of display to show the clock, but using real hardware is even cooler. 

Keeping it open source is neat, allowing other people to use it as well if they wish. Using an arduino and servos is really neat, I hope it works out. 

I'd totally join your group if I didn't already have one
