# Weasleys' Magical Clock (Response from Xin)
I am always a fan of Harry Potter and that Magical Clock draws my attention a lot. This project uses geofences to indicate the location of the users and use that information as indicators on the clock; I think this is very cool and interesting to learn about. I canâ€™t wait to see this app to be deployed online or as an android app that I can share with my friends. I wish I can contribute on both the front end or server side of the application, and I am also very intersted in learning  geofences in this project. 

## Business
Since this project is open source without business purpose, I think there are not much business license get involved in it. However, I think it is necessary to be careful with licenses on images or some open sourced third party packages.

## Legal
Since this is an open source project. I think that there is not much copy right or patent included. However, the project may include some elements with license that could involve in legal obligations.

## Technical
I think any technical tools would be great to use and there are so many options to choose. This depends on the team discussion.
